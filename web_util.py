def parse_table_headers(tags, html_str):

    This is for getting the data directly under the set of table headers on a
    page (for now).  By that I mean if a table passed was rendered such as this:

     _____ _____
    | Foo | Bar |
     ----- -----
    | 22  | 64  |
     ----- -----

    Then the data under 'Foo' would be 22, and the data under 'Bar' would be 64.

    The arguments required are a list of table header names (case insensitive) 
    that the callee intends to find in at most one of the table headers (the 
    last matching table header will have its value stored in the dictionary for
    now).

    For example, if we simply want the data under the headers 'Foo' and 'Bar,'
    we would pass ['Foo', 'Bar'] as the first parameter, and then if 'Foo' and
    'Bar' were found anywhere within the table headers of the html string that
    renders the example above, then as long as said value is not None, the value
    of the corresponding string that led to the match will be a key within the
    returned dictionary, with the value as the string directly below the header.

    From the above example, calling parse_table_headers(['Foo', 'Bar'], html),
    where html would render something similar to the above, the returned
    dictionary would be:

    { u'Foo': u'22', u'Bar': u'64' }
